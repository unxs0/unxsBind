OLD DEPRECATE ASAP

Very quick CentOS 5 install guide
---------------------------------

'yum' will provide a working system on your server for your
evaluation very quickly.

Single # is a command line operation
Double ## is a comment in command line operations

Does not cover setting installing a correct SSL cert, other servers,
editing your named.conf etc...etc...

Does not cover setting up boot init.d scripts for starting 
named, httpd and mysqld etc...


***NEW***
Note that the unxsBind required cron entries are now
added to /etc/cron.d/unxsbind by the init.d script. But,
only if you remove the old deprecated root crontab entries.

---
1-. Setup your /etc/yum.repos.d/ with the unxs.repo:

# wget http://unixservice.com/rpm/i386/unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm

## (optionally check md5sum of what you just downloaded)
# wget http://unixservice.com/rpm/i386/unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm.md5sum
# md5sum -c unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm.md5sum
## (if ok proceed to install rpm - we will not mention this check 
##	again but can be used for all our downloads.)

# rpm -i unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm

1b-. Faster method? 
Optionally just create /etc/yum.repos.d/unxs.conf with this content:
[unxsVZ]
name=unxsVZ
baseurl=http://unixservice.com/rpm/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
md5check=1

---
2-. Use yum to install unxsbind

# yum install unxsbind

This will setup everything including chkconfig boot settings.
It will install all provided interfaces with the base templates.

---
3-. Test everything. If you find anything wrong in this guide,
	in any interface, in the initial DNS system provided, please email us at
	support @ unixservice . com
